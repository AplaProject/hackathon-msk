# AplaBlockchainHack

AplaBlockchainHack hackathon took place in Moscow on the 13th to 15th of April 2018. More than 20 developer teams registered as participants in the event. 14 of them made it to the final project presentation. The best teams received not only monetary prizes, but also the opportunity to work with the hackathon partners: Russian Federal Agency for Intellectual Property, Patents and Trademarks, GazpromNeft Corporation, Rybakov-Fund Charitable Organization, and the IPChain Association.

The hackathon was brought together by Actum – a company that aims towards the development of an entrepreneur community with professional relations between young entrepreneurs and established businesses. The hackathon's technological partner – Apla – has developed their own blockchain platform. Accordingly, the main task for the development teams was to implement business-cases, provided by the hackathon partners, using Apla Blockchain as a platform. Both Apla and Actum are partners of the IPELab for development of the entrepreneur community.

## Hackathon Awards

Overall, the hackathon awards totaled in 1.5 million Rubles. This amount was contested by 15 projects delivered by 14 teams. Apla's main awards were given to four teams.
